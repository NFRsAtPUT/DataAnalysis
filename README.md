# DataAnalysis

The repo contains the tools, scripts used to analyze the data for empirical studies concerning non-functional requirements (NFRs) and NFR 
Templates.


## Exp-NFR-QCY

The ***goal*** of the study was to investigate usefulness of catalog of NFR templates as a mean supporting individual and group-based elicitation of NFRs in the context of inexperienced requirements elicitors. We focused on the following characteristics of elicited NFRs: quality (unambiguity, verifiability, individual completness (level of detail), set completness, and yield.

The folder contains an R Project with the scripts used to analyze the data and produce charts.
